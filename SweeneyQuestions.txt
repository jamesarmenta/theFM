When does first image manipulation occur?


Can image manipulation occur on pages other than the memory detail view?


What aspect are the photos?


Are you interested in Android compatability?


What kind of manipulation would you like to use? Blurring, white shapes... (JPEG compression? Color loss? Random pixel glitching? Pixel dragging?)
